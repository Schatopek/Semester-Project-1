                <h4>Cosmology</h4>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
                    sky
                    and what we can see and know
                    about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen
                    and
                    learn a bit about the early
                    navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early
                    Arab
                    traders, to Galileo’s telescope,
                    to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <h4>Evolution</h4>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                    we come from and how did we get
                    here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
                    understanding our place in this world.
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.
                    You can also take some time to meet
                    a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                    dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h4>Biology and Medicine</h4>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the
                    tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                    improved, thanks to the growth of our
                    understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a
                    look at some major breakthroughs
                    including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal
                    discoveries have come not only from the
                    lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <p>The information revolution is here, and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
                    future. From useful home applications
                    of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                    becomes that scientists explore how to
                    create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
